        <p>Hello, I am Dermott, but as an artist I go by Lost Boy. I create film and clothing that explore parts of my life, past and present that I feel need a creative path for myself to learn from. My film&rsquo;s explore experiences, places, and people I feel I want a more deep understanding of the love or confusion I have with it. As well as film, it opens my perspective within my clothing that I make only one of a kind. The films I create open my mind from a confusion and develope it into a garment that outlines my perspective of being lost. I continue to strive on a lost perspective as it directs me to take risk and frightening paths of the unknown and how I react to it makes me the lost boy I continue to develope myself into.&nbsp;</p>
